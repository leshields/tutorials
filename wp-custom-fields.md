# WordPress Custom Post Types and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

The purpose of this talk is to learn how to create WP custom post types and custom fields. We will create a basic plugin for our custom post type, then use ACF to create custom fields and modify the theme file to display the data on the front-end.

### Custom Post Types

What is a custom post type?
Why would we want to create them inside a plugin rather than inside the theme?

### Creating Advanced Custom Fields

Free, but Add-Ons cost (I have a license for Repeater Field)

### Retrieving ACF Data


### ASSIGNMENT

1. Create the plugin for Haxiom custom post type "member"
2. Create the ACF fields
3. Use ACF documentation to modify haxiom theme and add data to member post type
